    <h2></h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Gary Gardner and I live in Sierra Vista, Arizona. I love Mexican, Asia, and Italian food.  I really like to watch old television from the 50s to the 90s.  Such as MASH, Waltons, and Happy Days.  I also like to visit with my family such as my wife, children, parents, siblings, and now my two grandsons.</p> 
    <p>I have been working with computers ever since I used my first one at Ricks College in 1980, After graduation at Ricks College, I served a full-time mission in Idaho.  I grew up in Torrance California, and Idaho was pure culture and climate shock to a young surfer.</p>
    <p>Most of my career was spent working as a technical trainer, certified Microsoft professional, computer security specialist, and Cisco admin.  I had a stroke in 2002 when I was 42.  I am disabled and can only type with one hand, college has been a bit of a challenge.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ all my life.  My favorite quote is by President Kimball, DO IT NOW!  My favorite scripture is 1 Nephi 3:7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>
